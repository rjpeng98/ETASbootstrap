Title: Bootstrap Confidence Interval Estimation for 'ETAS' Model Parameters
Description: The 2-D spatial and temporal Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence ('ETAS') Model is
 widely used to 'decluster' earthquake data catalogs. Usually, the calculation of standard
 errors of the 'ETAS' model parameter estimates is based on the Hessian matrix derived from
 the log-likelihood function of the fitted model. However, when an 'ETAS' model is fitted to
 a local data set over a time period that is limited or short, the standard errors based on
 the Hessian matrix may be inaccurate. It follows that the asymptotic confidence intervals
 for parameters may not always be reliable. As an alternative, this package allows for the
 construction of bootstrap confidence intervals based on empirical quantiles for the parameters
 of the 2-D spatial and temporal 'ETAS' model. This version improves on Version 0.1.0 of the
 package by enabling the study space window (renamed 'study region') to be polygonal rather
 than merely rectangular. A Japan earthquake data catalog is used in a second example to
 illustrate this new feature.
