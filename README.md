# ETASbootstrap

For detailed documentation, please visit [the user manual](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ETASbootstrap/ETASbootstrap.pdf).

*ETASbootstrap* is developed to compute the bootstrap confidence intervals based on empirical quantiles for the parameters of the 2-D spatial and temporal 'ETAS' model.
This version improves on Version 0.1.0 of the package by enabling the study space window to be polygonal rather than merely rectangular.
